## Overview

The Face Detection App utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in images. It provides a simple interface within the Dataloop platform, allowing users to easily apply face detection to images in their datasets.

### Key Features

- **Face Detection**: Detect faces in images using OpenCV.
- **Integration with Dataloop**: Seamlessly integrates with the Dataloop platform for easy deployment and use.

## Installation

To install the Face Detection App:

1. Navigate to the **Marketplace** on the Dataloop platform.
2. Search for the "OpenCV Face Detection".
3. Click on **Install** to add the app to your project.
4. Once installed, you can access the face detection functionality through the item menu.

## Components

The solution comprises several key components as defined in the `dataloop.json` file:

- **Toolbars**: Provides a "Detect Face" button in the item menu.
- **Modules**: Includes a `face-detector` module with a `predict` function to process items.
- **Services**: Configures a service for the `face-detector` module with specific runtime settings.

## App Code Overview

The `face_detection.py` script is responsible for managing the app's face detection functionality:

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in images.
- **Annotation**: Automatically annotates detected faces in the Dataloop platform and upload the bounding boxes to the item.

## Configuration Overview

The `dataloop.json` file serves as the core configuration for the app. It defines various parameters, including app details, compute resources, modules, and services.

### Key Components

- **App Information**: Includes display name, description, and version.
- **Attributes**: Defines the appâ€™s characteristics, such as category and media type.
- **Compute Configurations**: Specifies resources and execution settings.
- **Modules**: Defines distinct functionalities within the app.
